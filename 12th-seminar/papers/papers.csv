To date the access to operational data in support of research claims or observed performance benefits is limited. Though the majority of related data sets are established and curated by government authorities, open data access is still in its infancy. ICAO promotes a performance based approach. In that light there is stronger interest in performing regional and international benchmarking comparisons. To advance the state of the art it is important to establish common methods and tools. This paper reports on the conceptualization of the benchmarking process as a data analytical workflow and the supporting developments of an open-source data-analytical toolbox. This feasibility study demonstrates the use of the process and open data to provide a framework under which official results can be validated. The benefits of this approach have been demonstrated throughout the on-going regional benchmarking projects. The toolbox developed offers scope to expand the functionality and make operational ANS performance analyses accessible to a wider audience interested in applying harmonized global standards."
1,123,A Comparative Analysis of Models for Predicting Delays in Air Traffic Networks,"Karthik Gopalakrishnan, Hamsa Balakrishnan (MIT)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_123.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_123.pdf,,Performance Measurement and Management,"In this paper, we compare the performance of dif-ferent approaches to predicting delays in air traffic networks. We consider three classes of models: A recently-developed aggregate model of the delay network dynamics, which we will refer to as the Markov Jump Linear System (MJLS), classical machine learning techniques like Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and three candidate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures. We show that prediction performance can vary significantly depending on the choice of model/algorithm, and the type of prediction (for example, classification vs. regression). We also discuss the importance of selecting the right predictor variables, or features, in order to improve the performance of these algorithms.  The models are evaluated using operational data from the National Airspace System (NAS) of the United States. The ANN is shown to be a good algorithm for the classification problem, where it attains an average accuracy of nearly 94% in predicting whether or not delays on the 100 most-delayed links will exceed 60 min, looking two hours into the future. The MJLS model, however, is better at predicting the actual delay levels on different links, and has a mean prediction error of 4.7 min for the regression problem, for a 2 hr horizon. MJLS is also better at predicting outbound delays at the 30 major airports, with a mean error of 6.8 min, for a 2 hr prediction horizon. The effect of temporal factors, and the spatial distribution of current delays, in predicting future delays are also compared. The MJLS model, which is specifically designed to capture aggregate air traffic dynamics, leverages on these factors and outperforms the ANN in predicting the future spatial distribution of delays. In this manner, a tradeoff between model simplicity and prediction accuracy is revealed."

We apply Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Forest regression techniques within the context of Geographically Weighted Regression. We estimate both the mean and 90th percentile responses for two performance indicators: average arrival delay and the number of cancelled arrivals.
3,50,Causal Inference for ATM Counterfactual Estimation,Akhil Shah (RAND Corporation),/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_50.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_50.pdf,,Performance Measurement and Management,"We propose that the Rubin potential outcomes framework of causal inference can be used to statistically estimate counterfactuals, by definition never observable, of Traffic Flow Management Initiatives (TFMI), as a novel means of quantifying the performance of Air Traffic Management (ATM) actions, despite confounding factors. Specifically, we apply the method of Propensity Scores to estimate counterfactuals and compute the increase in hourly average airborne delay which would have resulted without a Ground Delay Program, using an eleven month span of hourly weather, traffic, and delay data at JFK. Our introduction also summarizes the concepts of causal inference required for our analysis. We also offer suggestions to improve and extend our initial application of casual inference. Technical details of propensity score modeling are further covered in an appendix."
4,130,Causal Analysis of En Route Flight Inefficiency – the US Experience,"Yulin Liu, Mark Hansen (University of California, Berkeley), David Lovell, Cara Chuang, Michael Ball (University of Maryland), John Gulding (FAA)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_130.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_130.pdf,,Performance Measurement and Management,"En route inefficiency is measured in terms of extra distance flown by an aircraft, above the theoretical shortest distance (great circle) route. Three sources of inefficiency are explored: convective weather, miles-in-trail restrictions, and winds. Historical flight records are projected onto a small set of nominal trajectories clustered from historical data, and compared against the history of the potential causal factors. Statistical models reveal the estimated influence of the factors. In this case, convective weather was the most influential factor in seeming to cause flights to deviate from what would have been a less costly trajectory. Winds and miles-in-trail restrictions are also important for some origin-destination pairs, but less significant than convective weather."
5,52,A case study of non-linear dynamics of “human-flow” behavior in terminal airspace,"Lei Yang, Suwan Yin, Minghua Hu (NUAA), Yan Xu (Technical University of Catalonia)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_52.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_52.pdf,,Complexity and Big Data,"Air traffic is widely known as a complex and task-critical techno-social system mainly composed of airspace, procedures, aircraft and air traffic managers. In order to develop and deploy advanced operational concept and automation system scientifically and effectively, it is essential to take an in-depth research on the intrinsic air traffic dynamics and characteristics which haven’t been widely discussed. A systematical empirical study of air traffic operation in Guangzhou terminal airspace is conducted by collecting synchronized flight and air-ground communication data. Three types of metrics are proposed to measure air traffic dynamics from “human-flow” perspective: flow-based metrics, controller-based metrics and chaotic metrics. Empirical results identify synchronized free, smooth, semi-stable and congested phase states from both flow and controllers performance evolutions. Meta-cognition is explained as one of critical underlying mechanisms that drive the phase transitions. Further, by studying data series of potential conflict in “flow system” and communication behaviors in “human system”, air traffic system is proved to be a chaotic system, which presents higher short term chaotic predictability, caused by internal instability of semi-stable and congested status. These novel findings will provide theoretical basis for aggregated air traffic flow modeling, decision support system design and tactical flow management."

Efficient boarding procedures have to consider both operational constraints and the individual passenger behaviour. In contrast to the handling processes of fuelling, catering and cleaning, the boarding process is mainly driven by the passenger and not by airport or airline employees. Models for evaluating boarding sequences mainly depend more on assumptions concerning the individual passenger processes in the aircraft than on reliable field measurements. This paper provides a comprehensive set of operational data including classification of boarding times, passenger arrival times, time to store hand luggage, and passenger interactions as a fundamental basis for the calibration of boarding simulation models. In this paper, a microscopic approach is used to model the passenger behaviour, where the passenger movement is defined as a one-dimensional, stochastic, and time/space discrete transition process. This model is used to compare measurements from field trials of boarding procedures with simulation results and achieves an accuracy of ± 5%."
7,3,Local and network impact assessment of Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM),"Denis Huet (EUROCONTROL), Simon Pickup (Atlas Chase)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_3.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_3.pdf,,Integrated Airport/Airside Operations,"Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) is about sharing of information between all stakeholders that actively participate in the management of the arrival, turnaround and departure of an aircraft. The concept aims to integrate systems and processes to provide improved levels of turnaround predictability and take-off time accuracy that are of benefit to the ground operation locally and the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) respectively.     A 12 month study was initiated by EUROCONTROL to investigate the impact of A-CDM on local and ATM operations. The local assessment was driven primarily by information shared by the first 17 fully implemented CDM airports. Local benefits that were confirmed as part of the study include the reduction in average taxi-out times and push-back delays, increased ground handling resource utilisation and more expeditious recovery from adverse conditions. The network assessment was developed based on the significant improvement in take-off time predictability generated by CDM airports. The EUROCONTROL NEST tool was used to conduct simulations of the entire European ATM network in which CDM airports departed flights more predictably than non A-CDM airports. This study verified that increasing the number of implemented airports would deliver increases to enroute capacity due to the reduction in sector overload potential within the most congested area of the European airspace. Results suggest that a 3.5%-5.5% increase in enroute capacity could be realised when Europe’s top 50 airports become integrated. In addition, a discrete event simulation of a single enroute sector was developed to investigate the localised effects of increasing the proportion of flights arriving on each entry stream that originated from an airport that was transmitting Departure Planning Information (DPI) messages.  The conclusions reinforce the need to foster the implementation of A-CDM to more airports and to extend the concept to all airport processes (airside and landside) and therefore support the development of the SESAR Airport Operations Centre (APOC)."
8,105,Analysis of Saturation at the Airport-Airspace Integrated Operations,"Alvaro Rodriguez-Sanz, Fernando Gomez Comendador, Rosa Arnaldo Valdes (Technical University of Madrid),  Jose Manuel Cordero Garcia and Lucia Meler Garcia (CRIDA)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_105.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_105.pdf,,Integrated Airport/Airside Operations,"This paper develops a functional analysis of the operations that represent the aircraft flow through the airport-airspace system. In this analysis, we use a dynamic spatial boundary associated with the Extended Terminal Maneuvering Area (E-TMA) concept, so inbound and outbound timestamps can be considered. The aircraft path is characterized by several temporal milestones related to the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) method, which allows us to study the successive hierarchical tasks. By considering the accumulated delay across the different processes and its evolution, different metrics are proposed to evaluate the system’s state and its ability to ensure an appropriate aircraft flow in terms of time-saturation. The objective is to establish a taxonomy that classifies the system’s capacity to “receive and transmit” the expected aircraft flows. Finally, the relationships among the factors that influence the aircraft flow are evaluated to create a probabilistic graphical model, using a Bayesian Network approach. This model predicts outbound delays given the probability of having different values at the causal control variables. The methodology is developed through a case study at Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport (LEMD): a collection of 1,500 turnaround operations (registered at the peak month of 2015) is used to statistically determine the aircraft path characteristics. The contribution of the paper is twofold: it presents a new methodological approach to evaluate the system’s state at the rotation stage and it also provides insights on the interdependencies between factors influencing performance."
9,107,A novel machine learning model to predict abnormal Runway Occupancy Times and observe related precursors,"Floris Herrema (EUROCONTROL AND TUDelft), Vincent Treve, Bruno Desart (EUROCONTROL), Ricky Curran, Dries Visser (TUDelft)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_107.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_107.pdf,*,Integrated Airport/Airside Operations,"Accidents on the runway triggered the development and implementation of mitigation strategies.  Therefore, the airline industry is moving toward proactive risk management, which aims to identify and predict risk percursors and to mitigate risks before accidents occur.  For certain predictions Machine Learning techniques can be used.  Although many studies have explored and applied novel Machine Learning techniques on different aircraft Radar and operational Taxi data, the identification and prediction of abnormal Runway Occupancy Times and the observation of related percursors are not well developed.  In our previous papers, three feasible methods were introduced:  Lasso, Multi-Layer Perceptiona and Neural Networks to predict the Taxi-Out Time on the taxiway and the time to Fly and True Airspeed profile on final approach.  This paper presents a new Machine Learing method, where we merge these feasible Machine Learning techniques for prediction the abnormal Runway Occupancy times of unique radar data patterns.  Additionally we use in this study the Regression Tree method to observe key related precursors extracted from the top 10 features.  Compared with existing methods, the new method no longer requires predefined criteria or domain knowledge.  Tests were conductioned using runway and final approach aircraft radar data consisting of 78,321 Charles de Gaulle flights and were benchmarked against 500,000 Vienna flights."
10,23,What to say when: Guidelines to Decision Making,"Anne Papenfuss, Nils Carstengerdes, Sebastian Schier, Yves Günther (DLR)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_23.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_23.pdf,,Integrated Airport/Airside Operations,"Because airports are currently a bottleneck in the ATM system research and development effort is spent in creating high performing airport operations. In order to actively influence airport performance, joint decisions made in an Airport Operations Control Center (APOC) are proposed. This idea raises several research questions; one is in how far guidelines for a structured communication process mitigate factors like conflicts and personality which might prevent an effective and efficient decision making in the APOC. This paper explores the impact of a concept for cooperation for airport stakeholders in a planning task. Four teams with four airport experts took part in a high-fidelity study. The guidelines significantly improved experienced team effectiveness. Results show that guidelines lead to a more pro-active, information driven decision making and mitigate some effects of individual interaction behavior."

12,20,Read Back Error Detection using Automatic Speech Recognition,"Hunter Kopald, Shuo Chen, Ronald Chong, Yuan-Jun Wei and Zachary Levonian (MITRE)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_20.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_20.pdf,,Human Factors,"In the last few years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been investigating the use of automatic speech recognition in safety monitoring capabilities, with an initial focus on the tower domain. One application of speech recognition technology is the automatic detection of pilot read back errors that are not corrected by the controller. Uncorrected read back errors are one cause of runway incursions, one of the FAA’s primary surface safety concerns. To inform the FAA’s investigation into future speech recognition applications and mitigate the risk associated with future capability development, the MITRE Corporation (MITRE) is conducting research into the feasibility of a read back error detection capability that uses speech recognition to compare controller and pilot intent spoken in radio transmissions from the tower domain. Through this research, MITRE has developed a concept of use for the capability that includes a high level system design and a graphical user interface design. Additionally, MITRE conducted an evaluation of speech recognition performance on controller and pilot radio transmissions to assess the accuracy achievable with established speech recognition technology and tuning methods. Preliminary results from the research indicate that speech recognition performance on controller and pilot speech is promising, but more research is needed to refine the capability logic, improve speech recognition accuracy, and assess operational acceptability of its performance."
13,22,Increasing ATM Efficiency with Assistant Based Speech Recognition,"Hartmut Helmke, Oliver Ohneiser (German Aerospace Center, DLR), Jörg Buxbaum (DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH), Christian Kern (Austro Control GmbH)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_22.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_22.pdf,*,Human Factors,"Initiatives to integrate Automatic Speech Recognition into Air Traffic Management (ATM) exists at least since the late 90s. Some success to replace pseudo pilots have been reported, but its integration into controller assistant tools is missing. Ger-man Aerospace Center (DLR) and Saarland University devel-oped Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) enabling com-mand recognition rates better than 95%. However, good recogni-tion rates are no convincing argument for decision makers. Therefore, we conducted an ABSR validation study with eight air traffic controllers to quantify the benefits with respect to work-load and efficiency. The study validates that ABSR does not just reduce controllers’ workload, which would already be a lot, but this paper presents that ABSR significantly increases ATM effi-ciency. Fuel reductions of 60 liters (16 gallons) per flight and a throughput increase by two arrivals per hour are possible."
14,61,Analysis on the Impact of Pop-Up Flight Occurrence when Extending the Arrival Management Horizon,"Alexander Vanwelsenaere, Joost Ellerbroek, Jacco M. Hoekstra (Delft University of Technology), Evert Westerveld (Air Traffic Control the Netherlands)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_61.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_61.pdf,,Terminal Area Operations,"The occurrence of pop-up flights negatively affects the (extended) arrival manager. This issue is known already for a long time by operational experts, but the extent thereof has now been assessed during experiments. An arrival manager research model was developed and integrated in BlueSky, an open-source air traffic management simulator. Fast-time simulations showed that extended arrival management is significantly negatively affected by pop-up flights, in terms of flight crew and air traffic control task load, sequence stability and delay (cost). Simulations also indicated that this impact could be mitigated by pre-planning pop-up flights prior to departure, using their take-off time estimates. This will, however, only be beneficial when these estimates are sufficiently accurate. With currently achievable accuracies, and using currently available systems, it is better to discard these estimates in the context of extended arrival management."
15,43,Measuring Performance of Initial Ground-based Interval Management - Spacing (GIM-S) Operations,"Brock Lascara, Lesley Weitz, Thomas Monson (MITRE), Robert Mount (FAA)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_43.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_43.pdf,,Terminal Area Operations,"The Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) automation system provides scheduling and scheduling-management tools to Air Traffic Control (ATC) to support time-based metering operations.  Time-based metering is used to develop an orderly and efficient flow of traffic in en route airspace to coordinate delivery to the terminal. Recent enhancements to TBFM include the introduction of Ground-based Interval Management–Spacing (GIM-S). GIM-S introduces three new functions to improve time-based metering operations: extended metering, coupled scheduling, and speed advisories. The expected benefits of GIM-S include increased meter point delivery accuracy, reduced vectoring, and increased use of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures. These benefits are expected to translate into more consistent and predictable arrival operations for air carriers. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the impact of GIM-S operations relative to the aforementioned benefits. Results indicate that time-based metering operations are improved with the use of GIM-S; however, the varied and inconsistent use of GIM-S between en route facilities reduces the data available for review and reflects operational models that are not necessarily consistent with the envisioned use to maximize benefits."
16,30,Analysis of the Use of Estimated Time of Arrival Broadcast for Interval Management,"Stephanie Priess, Lesley Weitz, Stuart Bowman (MITRE), Ian Levitt (FAA)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_30.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_30.pdf,,Terminal Area Operations,"Interval Management (IM) is a NextGen application that requires accurate Estimated Times of Arrival (ETAs) in order to achieve a desired inter-aircraft spacing at a downstream point. Current standards require that the IM avionics calculate an ETA for the Target aircraft against which the IM aircraft is managing its relative spacing interval. In the future, this requirement could be replaced by a requirement that the Target aircraft broadcast the ETA generated by its Flight Management System (FMS). This ETA is expected to be more accurate than the ETA calculated by the IM avionics, and should thus result in more precise inter-aircraft spacing. This paper presents a comparison of IM performance between the current standards environment and a future environment where the Target aircraft broadcasts its ETA. Intuitively, basic technical IM performance metrics would improve when using the Target aircraft’s broadcast ETA, but simulation results did not show increased performance benefit over the current IM avionics standard. This is due both to the environment under study, and the IM closed-loop performance being robust to inaccuracies in the calculation of the Target aircraft’s ETA."
17,57,Design Considerations of Vertically-Constrained PBN Procedures for Trajectory Management,"Jesper Bronsvoort (Airservices Australia), Greg McDonald (Independent), Jean Boucquey (EUROCONTROL), Sergio Torres (Leidos), Joachim Hochwarth (GE Aviation), Mike Paglione, Christina Young (FAA)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_57.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_57.pdf,**,Terminal Area Operations,"This paper investigates the interdependencies between the design of PBN procedures, FMS operating logic, and the concept of 4 Dimensional Trajectory Downlink (4D-TRAD). Constraints that are added to PBN procedures, e.g. altitude and speed constraints, can impact on the potential to absorb delay through airborne time-of-arrival-control capabilities in a concept like 4D-TRAD. Logically, speed constraints are detrimental to the delay absorption potential, but the appropriate use of altitude constraints can lead to increased delay absorption potential. Forcing the aircraft to descent earlier than the optimal top of descent, increases the flight time window at the expense of additional fuel burn. In this paper a concept is investigated whereby an altitude requirement can be dynamically set by ATC to increase the delay absorption potential, when required, while providing a closed-loop clearance that can be entered in the FMS. Typical delay absorption potential by airborne time-of-arrival-control capabilities is compared to a sample of actual flight data. It is concluded that typical delay is generally in excess of what can be absorbed. Therefore, even if delay-potential allowances are designed into PBN procedures, like discussed in this paper, there will be a strong reliance on improved air traffic flow management procedures, to enable full 4D trajectory management, runway to runway."
18,103,Toward the characterisation of sequencing arrivals,"Raphael Christien, Eric Hoffman, Aymeric Trzmiel, Karim Zeghal (EUROCONTROL)",/seminarContent/seminar12/papers/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_paper_103.pdf,/seminarContent/seminar12/presentations/12th_ATM_RD_Seminar_presentation_103.pdf,,Terminal Area Operations,"This paper proposes a novel approach to understand and characterise the sequencing of arrivals. The proposed approach, essentially data driven, relies on the analysis of the spacing evolution over time between consecutive aircraft. As a case study, it was applied to different sequencing techniques (a baseline and two new ones) in the same approach environment, using track data from human in the loop simulations. The analysis conducted enables to characterise how the spacing evolves in time, and reveals differences among the three techniques in terms of convergence speed. The spacing deviation containment decreases faster with the new techniques, suggesting that the sequencing is anticipated and performed earlier. Typical sequencing patterns have been identified that also reveal the early sequencing. Future work will involve considering different environments and extending the horizon of analysis to capture the complete arrival process."

Therefore, PBN clearly acts as a contributor to safety and accessibility of terrain-challenged airports [2]. However, in some cases, the design criteria for Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures show disadvantages over conventional criteria when it comes to the geometric layout of obstacle protection areas. In such cases, the strict separation between PBN and conventional procedures may not support the best operational solution whereas relinquishing this separation in favor of a hybrid approach to ICAO procedure standards can produce very promising results. The concrete example of the development of a hybrid procedure for one of the world’s most complex airport locations will be shown in this paper to advocate the use of both PBN and conventional design criteria in a “mixed toolbox” concept to achieve even higher levels of accessibility to critical terrain airports whilst maintaining the highest levels of safety."

The data consisted of departure, arrival and approach transition instrument flight procedures. Using a custom built application and filtering process, tactical interventions from Air Traffic Control were removed from the dataset. The remaining dataset was used to compute cross-track deviations from the route centerline of the procedures, both along straight segments and in turns. For the turns the route centerline was defined by an average turn radius which was calculated for each turn in the procedure. These cross-track deviations were used to compute lateral navigation performance distributions for straight segments, turns and for different speed and turn angle categories. The general observation was that according to these computed performance distributions, the actual lateral navigation performance of the current fleet in Europe operating to the three major airports from which data was collected, is outstanding and far better than the required navigation performance defined in the ICAO standards. For example, the lateral track keeping accuracy along straight segments, for groundspeeds exceeding 350 knots, had a standard deviation of only 0.07NM. Subsets of data consisting of aircraft navigating without GNSS were also analyzed. Finally the performance distributions were injected in a Collision Risk Model (CRM) to determine the required route spacing for a set of sample parallel route configurations in function of a target level of safety. It was concluded that, thanks to the excellent actual navigation performance, navigation performance is not the prevalent factor anymore in route spacing determination in a radar environment. Instead, radar separation minima and human factors such as the controller’s screen resolution and ATC sector size are the more dominant elements for the determination of route spacing minima."

It uses various data mining methods, as well as a maximum likelihood estimation approach to generate parametric models for these performance parameters. All parametric models combined can be used to describe a complete flight that includes takeoff, initial climb, climb, cruise, descent, final approach, and landing. Both analytical results and summaries are shown. When available, optimal parameters from these models are also compared with the Base of Aircraft Data and Eurocontrol aircraft performance database.

The conclusions from this analysis show that ADS-B indeed is a promising technology, where aircraft are able to accurately report their navigational parameters, but that external factors (e.g., reception probability and malfunctioning on-board equipment) can cause issues with the usability of ADS-B as a primary means of surveillance."

This notion of airspace stability has been used in previous literature to develop a semi-empirical method for determining the capacity of a decentralized direct-routing airspace concept in the horizontal plane. The present paper extends this method by explicitly mod-eling: a) the effect of a given Con?ict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) strategy on the stability of the airspace; b) the in?uence of direct-routing on instantaneous con?ict probability; and c) the impact of ?nite-time measurements on the determination of airspace states. To validate the resulting analytical capacity model, fast-time simulations were performed. The results indicate that the predictions of the analytical model are close to that of the previous semi-empirical approach. Thus, the analytical model can be used to obtain a ?rst-order estimate of the maximum theoretical capacity, as along as simulation settings do not cause the ‘local’, or per aircraft, con?ict rate to deviate signi?cantly from assumptions made during the model derivation. Future work will focus on relaxing model assumptions, and extending the modeling approach to three-dimensional airspace."

Tactical interventions from the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system to preserve safety distances between aircraft have some inherent shortages when scalability problems arise, that could lead to a well-known capacity saturation. An increased number of detected conflicts in dense traffic volumes can affect not only the ATC procedures but also the full safety net, since the present Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) has been designed only for low dense areas. To overcome these shortages at tactical level without appealing to the strategic airspace restrictions, this paper presents an innovative automation-based concept in future design of the ATM system supporting an irruptive shift from the centrally controlled ATM system to a distributed system, in which a set of aircraft constitutes a dynamic ecosystem, with self-governed capabilities, to find the optimal conflict-free resolution trajectories. The concept has been developed within the methodological approach “hotspot-cluster-ecosystem” which provides a smooth transition from trajectory management (TM), separation management (SM) to the collision avoidance (CA) layer, seeking for an advanced time horizon in which the airspace users would timely negotiate resolutions before an ATC directive is issued. A dynamic demand-capacity balance (DCB) approach is illustrated by identifying clusters and analyzing ecosystems considering deviations of pairwise conflicting aircraft to the surrounding traffic (ST). The ecosystem is described by its membership size and spatially temporal interdependencies (STIs), i.e. potential 4D positions of the members driven by defined maneuverability checks, and generated conflict intervals between each pair of members. Finally, computed interdependencies provide an insight of the ecosystem complexity through the ratio of a total number of feasible resolutions over the ecosystem time."

However, it is a common challenge for researchers who have no access to this proprietary information. Previously, several studies have proposed methods to estimates aircraft weight, most of which are focused on specific parts of the flight. Often due to inaccurate input data or biased assumptions, a significant number of estimates can result outside of the weight limitation boundaries. This paper proposes an approach that makes use of multiple observations to get a better estimate for a complete flight. By looking at flight data from a complete trajectory and calculating aircraft mass at different flight phases based on different methods, together with fuel flow models, multiple observations of aircraft initial mass can then be derived. Using the Bayesian inference method, final estimates can be made with a higher level of confidence."

Due to its dependence on factors such as the passenger and cargo load factors as well as operating strategies, the TOW of a particular flight is generally not available to entities outside of the operating airline. The above observations motivate the development of accurate TOW estimates that can be used for fuel burn estimation or trajectory prediction.  This paper proposes a statistical approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to determine both a mean estimate of the TOW and the associated confidence interval, using observed data from the takeoff ground roll. The predictor variables are chosen by considering both their ease of availability and the underlying aircraft dynamics. The model development and validation are conducted using Flight Data Recorder archives, which also provide ground truth data.  The proposed models are found to have a mean TOW error of 3%, averaged across eight different aircraft types, resulting in a nearly 50% smaller error than the models in the Aircraft Noise and Performance (ANP) database. In contrast to the ANP database which provides only point estimates of the TOW, the GPR models quantify the uncertainty in the estimates by providing a probability distribution.  Finally, the developed models are used to estimate aircraft fuel flow rate during ascent. The TOW estimated by the GPR models is used as an input to the fuel flow rate estimation. The proposed statistical models of the TOW are shown to enable a better quantification of uncertainty in the fuel flow rate as compared to the deterministic ANP models, or to models that do not use the TOW as an explicit input."

These tools are underpinned by a trajectory predictor.   Research has shown that more accurate inputs to these trajectory prediction (TP) algorithms yield more accurate results. Previous research has focussed on aircraft mass and more accurate meteorological data.  This study investigated the effect of including downlinked Mode S Indicated Airspeed (IAS) as a Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) value into the TP calculation. The effect was measured on the accuracy and stability of the prediction during the climb portion of each flight.  Five potential approaches were implemented in a MATLAB test harness and the performance was compared against the accuracy and stability of the Eurocontrol Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) baseline implementation.   To test the approaches a dataset consisting of all the flights on a typical busy day in the UK airspace was used. This dataset yielded 2,219 climb segments from 715 flights to analyse. The dataset resulted in almost 280,000 performance points, distributed over the different evaluated TP models.  These results show that the effect of including Mode S IAS on the vertical accuracy is marginal.  The along track accuracy shows significant improvement when Mode S IAS is included.  The inclusion of Mode S IAS does have a detrimental effect on the TP CAS stability as the CAS is no longer a constant in the climb portion.   Of the tested approaches, a one dimensional Kalman filter shows most promise in terms of trade-off between TP accuracy and CAS stability.  Furthermore, the Kalman filter should be easier to prove in a safety environment and expanded to include other parameters in order to provide better accuracy and performance."

However, the ATCO still needs to be in the control loop to make critical decisions. Human-automation collaboration requires teamwork, based on common ground and implicit communication. To design automation that supports teamwork and implicit communication, the automation must know how the ATCO is working. Sensors, like eye-tracking, and work patterns of the ATCO can give important information regarding the current situation in order for the automation to provide situation based support, through implicit communication to the ATCO. This paper addresses the current lack of teamwork and implicit communication between the ATCO and the automation in today’s air traffic control towers. Two case studies, using eye-tracking, were conducted. One study in a single tower simulator and one in a multiple remote tower simulator with three airports. The results show varying work patterns in three different stages of managing aircraft arrivals. This paper also discusses the potential for implicit communication and how work patterns are a foundation for designing air traffic control systems allowing teamwork."

This data is a collection of workload mesurements extracted from past sector operations and of ATC complexity measurements computed from radar records and airspace data (sector geometry).  We assume that the workload is low when a given sector is collapsed with other sectors into a larger sector, normal when it is operated as is, and high when it is split into smaller sectors assigned to several working positions.  This learning problem is modeled as a classification problem where the target variable is a workload category (low, normal, high) and the explanatory variables are the air traffic control (ATC) complexity metrics.  Several classifiers are compared on this problem: linear dis-criminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, naive Bayes classifiers, neural networks, and gradient boosted trees. The performance of these models is assessed on a separate test set. The best methods show a rate of correct predictions around 82%."

In order to increase the chance of air traffic control approval, the automation ensures that the route is clear of known traffic, weather, and airspace restrictions. Hence the technology is anticipated to provide benefits in areas such as flight efficiency, flight schedule compliance, passenger comfort, and pilot and controller workload. In support of a field trial of a prototype of the technology, observations were conducted at the Atlanta and Jacksonville air traffic control centers to identify the main factors that affect the acceptability of aircrew requests by air traffic controllers. Observers shadowed air traffic controllers as the test flight pilot made pre-scripted requests to invoke acceptability issues and then they interviewed voluntarily fifty controllers with experience ranging from one to thirty-five years. The most common reason for rejecting requests is conflicting with traffic followed by violating air traffic procedures, increasing sector workload, and conflicting with major arrival and departure flows and flow restrictions. Quantitative parameters such as the distance that a route should maintain from sector boundaries and special use airspace were identified and recommended for inclusion in the automation."

The modelconsiders the preferred 4D-trajectory of all the flights in the pre-tactical planning phase and outputs an optimalpre-departure 4D-trajectory for each flight to be shared or negotiated with other stakeholders and subsequently managed throughout the flight. These output trajectories are obtained by minimising the deviation (in terms of time delay, lateral and vertical deviation) from the original preferred trajectories. Theparticularities of this model are that it considers thecomplete 4D-trajectory for each flight as well as it incorporates the preferences and priorities of the ATM stakeholders. Some computational results are presented, which show that our optimization model has the ability to identify some trade-offs between the objectives of the stakeholders of the ATM system under the TBO concept.It can also provide the network manager with useful decision tools to choose a trajectory for each flight."

In this way, ATFM performance can be improved when handling delay assignment with uncertainty. Firstly, a trajectory generation method is presented, aiming at computing, per flight, the maximum linear holding realizable using the same fuel as the original nominal flight. This information is assumed to be computed and shared by the different airlines and it is then used to build a network ATFM model to optimally assign ATFM delays, in the scope of trajectory based operations. Hence, the best distribution of delay is optimized at given positions along the flight trajectory (combining the three holding practices together) and taking into account the cost of delay, especially in the fuel consumption. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming and solved with a commercially-of-the-shelf solver. An illustrative example is given, showing that under the circumstance of capacity recovered ahead of schedule, including linear holding contributes to a notable delay reduction compared to the case where only ground and/or airborne holding apply."

Second, a BDI agent-based formation coalition model is developed to capture the structural characteristics of formations and the mental and behavioral characteristics of flights under incomplete information. Third, a Bayesian negotiation algorithm is constructed, within which Harsanyi transformation is used to transform the formation coalition problem under incomplete information to a Bayesian-equivalent coalition problem under imperfect information. Experiments indicate that the model proposed in this study is fast convergent and produces an equitable formation flight economy split among fleets.

In this paper we extend the 2D-framework introduced in 2013, which separates the model from the solver. First, we introduce a 3D-model and add new refinements on the uncertainty model taking into account, inter alia, delays due to human factors. Second, we compare the performance of a complete Constraint Programming solver and an approximation algorithm based on a Memetic Algorithm, an efficient metaheuristic combining Genetic Algorithm with Tabu Search. To this aim, we generate a benchmark of conflict resolution problems built with scenarios involving 15 to 100 aircraft, 3 different levels of uncertainty and maneuvers in both horizontal and vertical planes. The two methods are able to efficiently solve moderate size problems in near real time, but the execution time of the complete algorithm exponentially rockets with larger instances whereas the metaheuristic scales much better with the number of aircraft. However, the former is able to prove optimality or infeasibility on reasonable problems, which allows the assessment of the quality of the solutions produced by the latter."

The methods for classifying aircraft categories were studied systematically, and the parameters termed as Required Decay Distance (RDD) and Wake Vortex Impedance (WVI) were proposed by authors to consider the influence of leading aircraft’s wake vortex circulation, and the resistant ability of following aircraft when encountering wake vortex. By comparing RECAT-I with RECAT-EU, the standard we proposed called RECAT-NEW can obtain more balanced and reasonable results in safety domain.

This paper proposes a parametric pilot response model built from operational data using Bayesian networks. A network was constructed from radar recordings of TCAS encounters and the encounter parameters with the strongest influence on pilot response were identified. These pa-rameters can be used to predict the probability of pilot response for individual encounters. The model was employed in simulation of safety-critical encounters. Results showed that standard pilot response models may underestimate collision risk. These results have implications for the design and performance evaluation of separation advisory systems, including collision avoidance and detect and avoid systems."

To this end, in this paper, con?ict rate models are developed to determine the intrinsic safety of unstructured and layered airspace designs. In comparison to previous work, the present models consider con-?icts between aircraft in different ?ight phases. Thus, con?icts for climbing and descending traf?c, as well as for cruising aircraft, are taken into account when computing the total con?ict rate. To validate the models, fast-time simulations were performed for several different layered airspace concepts, and for unstructured airspace. The results indicate that the models are able to estimate the con?ict rate for high traf?c densities using a model ?t for low densities. When comparing the different layered airspace concepts tested, the model predicted, and the simulation results con?rmed, a clear safety improvement when the permitted heading range per altitude band is reduced. Thus the models can be used to study the effect of airspace design parameters on the safety of unstructured and layered airspace concepts."

The current paper addresses the question if similarly good emergent behaviour is feasible with a ground based TBO design. The key findings are twofold. A negative finding is that ground-based TBO is not providing the remarkably positive emergent behaviours of pure airborne TBO. Though a positive finding is that ground-based TBO has the potential to safely accommodate high en route traffic demands."

As phases of NextGen, SESAR and Australian AATMP come to maturity, the questions are pivoting from what benefits will be to what have we achieved.   This pivot puts pressure on aircraft fuel modeling techniques being able to distinguish between the contribution of ATM and non-ATM factors. In addition, there are many fuel estimators used around the world, and their range of fidelity varies widely; in fact, fuel savings as result of ATM improvements are frequently of the same magnitude of the error produced by the models used for their estimation. This paper summarizes an initial collaboration between researchers from several globally recognized institutions to address the question of fidelity of fuel estimation that may be required for different types of benefit assessments of Air Traffic Management improvements. Interviews were conducted initially to categorize common elements that typical ATM studies share. An international team of fuel modelers was assembled and participated by running their models on a common set of inputs. The outputs generated by these models, were categorized using metrics on empirical trajectories and other operational data, including predicted fuel burn. This provided a foundation for studying impacts of different fuel estimation approaches and assumptions, and how they relate to the analysis of fuel efficiency."

One fuel-saving opportunity for airlines is the possibility of reducing contingency fuel loading. Airline flight planning system (FPS) provides recommended statistical contingency fuel (SCF) for dispatchers. However, due to limitations of the current SCF estimation procedure, the application of SCF is limited. In this study, we propose to use quantile regression based method to estimate more reliable SCF values. Utilizing a large fuel burn dataset from a major U.S. based airline, we find that the proposed quantile regression method outperforms airline’s FPS. We also quantify the impact of implementing improved SCF values in saving fuel. While maintaining a same safety level, it has been found that for our study airline, the benefit of applying improved SCF models is estimated to be in the magnitude of $14 million annual savings as well as 98 million kilogram CO2 emission reduction. This study also builds a link between SCF95 estimation and aviation system predictability in which the proposed models can also be used to predict benefits from reduced fuel loading enabled by improved air traffic management (ATM) targeting on improved system predictability."

The trends in the vertical efficiency pools are examined both over time and for differing levels of congestion.  The results are compared to more general metrics produced in a related NextGen scorecard and consider the impact of the initiatives that have been deployed at each site. If an initiative had the desired impact on descent efficiency, and appropriate normalization factors are chosen, then the pool of potential benefits should diminish after implementation.

Traditional noise analysis techniques such as the Aviation Environmental Design Tool model noise using a Noise Power Distance method, which does not fully capture aerodynamic and velocity effects.  An alternative physics-based modeling approach has been developed to capture higher-fidelity noise impacts.  This framework has been used to evaluate several candidate operational procedures for community noise impact."

These capacity limits typically cause inef?ciencies in ?ight and in airport ground handling, which are expecting to increase, because according to current market forecasts, passenger air traf?c demand will continue to grow between 4.5 percent [1] and 4.8 percent annually [2]. To better manage rare airspace capacity, free routing performance based navigation and harmonized airspace structures are seen as ef?cient mitigation measures according to the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) and the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) programs. However, a growing public awareness and a better understanding of the anthro-pogenic environmental impact necessitates further functions for ?ight planing and execution, beside today’s minimum fuel and time objectives. In this paper we present a trajectory calculation model capable of exploiting the 3D free route optimization potential while considering these divergent targets, especially the costs of condensation trails depending on the time of the day. The model was implemented in the simulation environment TOMATO for a case study, which optimized the European’s ?ight intentions for an entire day based on departure airport, arrival airport and departure time on July 2016. The resulting trajectories are evaluated against the number of separation infringements. The case study shows that this anticipated air traf?c demand already stresses the free route capacity when considering the required airline ef?ciency, ecological compatibility and safety standards."

New approach designs like curved Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures to independent parallel runway systems can decrease the noise footprint in sensitive ground areas without reducing airport capacity.    So far, only straight-in ILS (or MLS) approaches are allowed for independent parallel approach operations. To introduce RNP curved/segmented approaches as a further option for independent approaches to a parallel runway system, a safety concept has been developed by DLR in recent years based on the ICAO SaRPS for independent parallel approaches (ICAO Doc 9643). Following this concept, curved RNP approach operations should be possible at Frankfurt/Main airport enabling noise abatement even in high density traffic situations.    This paper considers the operational aspects of independent segmented parallel approach procedures at major airport-hubs with parallel runway systems like Frankfurt Airport. It reports about a new route design enabling the management of mixed aircraft equipage. The focus is on the operational feasibility of the new TMA design. This has been assessed by a real-time simulation with controllers of the German Air Navigation Service (DFS). The results of these simulations are presented in this paper."

Particularly, the air traffic over the North Atlantic airspace has witnessed an incessant increase. This increase was expected since it connects two densely-populated areas, namely North America and Europe. Otherwise, up to now the efficiency of trans-Atlantic flights is low due to the limited navigational equipment and radar coverage. The availability of Automated Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) systems represents a new opportunity to better the strategic planning of flights over the oceanic area by reducing the separation standards. Besides, oceanic flights are subject to very strong winds. Recently, several researches proved that flying wind-optimal route yields to a significant fuel and time savings for each flight. Thus, optimizing trans-Atlantic routes and providing reliable flight trajectories become a primordial issue for the oceanic air traffic management.  In this paper, we propose a new trans-Atlantic route structure that benefits from the jet streams in order to construct wind-optimal flight trajectories. First, we describe the methodology used to design our new route structure. Then, an optimization model for detecting and resolving conflicts is introduced. The analysis was carried out in real traffic data to prove the efficiency of the developed method. Experimental findings show that our approach provides encouraging results in terms of conflict resolution and time savings."

Instead controllers rely on rules-of-thumb to define the airport acceptance rate (AAR). As the approach is inherently subjective, it can lead to poor definition of Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) which rely on accurate airport capacity estimates and can lead to under-delivery or over-delivery of flights to airports. In this paper we propose a methodology for estimating airport capacity and capacity uncertainty based on the environmental conditions within the terminal and airport arrival routes and the projected arrival demand and aircraft spacing. To make these predictions we used a gradient tree boosting model in which the prediction model estimates are time-lagged and conditioned on the previous states. Additionally, estimates from previously predicted states are also used to condition the model based on the history of the predictor variables. The concept was validated against observations from historical data recorded at Newark Liberty Airport (EWR). The proposed method provides accurate prediction of airport capacity and produces a strong quantification of uncertainty in the form of a prediction interval. To explore the implications of applying information about the capacity uncertainty into planning in ground delay programs (GDPs), a stochastic integer programming model for GDP planning was created using the specific quantiles to define a constraint on airport capacity. This model allows the decision maker to make trades based on quantified levels of capacity deviation uncertainty. The results of a sensitivity analysis suggest that the decision maker may benefit from adopting a modest risk premium when planning GDPs."

The goal is to enable effective information sharing between airspace blocks in strategic planning, and to minimize interaction between trajectories. The proposed model and overall methodology is implemented and tested with a full day air traffic data over the European airspace.

When air traffic control (ATC) believes that a sector will exceed its maximal capacity, a regulation is applied to it, which limits the number of aircraft entering the sector. These actions have a large cost, as they affect all the flights that cross the sector. Moreover, they are based on the partial data available to the controller and do not take into account the network situation.  First, we propose a probabilistic framework for modeling air traffic occupancy count and sector congestion. This allows us to provide ATC with more precise information on the probability of sector overload. Second, based on this framework, we define metrics for individual flights that measure their impact on the congestion of the whole network. These metrics are intended to be used in demand and capacity balancing tools, allowing for optimized choices for the whole network.  We present numerical experiments for one day of European data, which included 33,219 flights in 1,991 elementary sectors. The simulations advocate our metrics and show how actions taken on selected flights have a positive impact on the network congestion."

An important aspect of this challenge is how to determine and manage 4-dimensional trajectories for both manned and unmanned aircraft, and how to appropriately allo-cate resources among different aircraft. An integrated approach requires solving the traditional Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) problem to balance the capacity and demand of airport and airspace resources, but at a significantly larger scale. In doing so, aircraft connectivity constraints of commercial flights must be satisfied. In addition to these and the resource capacity constraints, geofencing constraints for unmanned aircraft that keep them within or outside a certain region of the airspace, must also be incorporated.  This paper presents a distributed implementation of an integer programming approach for solving large-scale ATFM problems in the presence of unmanned aircraft. Given desired mission plans and flight-specific operating and delay costs, the pro-posed approach uses column generation to determine optimal trajectories in space and time, in the presence of network and flight connectivity constraints, airport and airspace capacity constraints, and geofencing constraints. Using projected demand for the year 2030 from the United States with approximately 48,000 passenger flights and 29,000 UAS operations (on a wide range of missions) per day, we show that our implementation can find nearly-optimal trajectories for a 24-hour period in less than 4 minutes. Furthermore, a rolling horizon implementation (with 6-8 hour time windows) results in run times of less than a minute. In addition to being the largest instances of the ATFM problem solved to date, these results represent the first effort to incorporate UAS trajectories into airspace and airport resource sharing problems."

An initial IDM concept for clear weather operations was developed and evaluated for potential benefits, including efficiency, delay reduction, predictability and throughput, and to identify any major issues that might represent a showstopper for a fielded application. Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) arrival operations provided a use case for concept development. EWR uses miles-in-trail (MIT) metering to regulate demand into TBFM during high volume operations, and short-haul flights are often penalized with excessive, last-minute ground delays when the overhead stream is saturated. IDM addresses this problem by replacing MIT conditioning with CTOP to better manage the demand delivery to the TBFM entry points. A “quasi-real time” high-fidelity simulation that would normally involve participants was conducted using heuristic-based procedures that mimicked operators’ behaviors instead. Five total conditions were compared: two baseline conditions with MIT delivery to TBFM entry points using two different TBFM settings; and three IDM conditions:  one with airborne speed control using an Required Time of Arrival (RTA) capability, a second without RTA, and a third with no wind forecast errors. Results suggest that the IDM concept can deliver traffic more efficiently by shifting the delays from airborne to ground for both RTA and non-RTA conditions, while maintaining a target throughput rate. The results also suggest that with good predictability of airport capacity, excessive TBFM ground delay can be minimized by applying more strategic CTOP delay, increasing predictability for the airline operators. Overall findings indicate that the implementation of an IDM concept under clear weather conditions can improve NAS system performance. Future IDM research aims to expand the concept to address demand/capacity imbalance due severe weather."

Using a variation on Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, reroutes are designed for one or more flights, where multi-flight problems promote the active design of reroute flows. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to evaluate trade-offs between multiple criteria of operational acceptability, removing the need to pre-define relative metric weightings. Finally, a combination of Principal Components Analysis and Spectral Clustering is used to identify distinct groups of solutions and representative reroutes that capture different trade-offs between metrics of operational acceptability.  Results are generated for a historical convective weather event and evaluated for their characterization of the trade-space."

The tested scenarios involved two different types of UASs – flying at 80 kts and 160 kts – with various missions, and three strategies for separation: one focussing on the separation distance, one focussing on the UAS mission and and combination of both.  Fast-time simulation was used to evaluate each scenario against a wide range of accuracy levels corresponding to required navigation precision standards and linked to on-board navigation and communication systems. Experiments reveal a strong robustness of the separation algorithm up to relatively high uncertainty levels, indicating that UASs equipped with low accuracy navigation systems can still manage proper separation. However, the maneuvering cost for separation increases when the accuracy deteriorates. Nevertheless, a UAS with GPS-based navigation in a collaborative environment (e.g. aircraft providing their navigation parameters through ADS-B) can expect robustness at a reasonable cost."

The use of UAS for covering wide areas implies the consideration of airspace restrictions and static and dy-namic obstacle avoidance. This results in complex shapes that need to be partitioned adequately to ensure coverage. Another important element for consideration in the generation of safe and efficient trajectories of UAS is the wind field. Typically, in severe wind scenarios, wind is considered often a hazardous condition. However, recent studies show that proper identification of the wind field could be used to increase the energy efficiency of the mission. This paper presents a novel method of area decomposition and partition that ensures coverage by generating a triangular mesh to optimize the coverage in the presence of urban areas, airspace restrictions or even the presence of an obstacle. The waypoint sequencing considers the wind field in order to perform on-line adjustments to ensure energy gains or to minimize energy losses with the identified wind field. For this purpose, an innovative method for wind identification is proposed which analyses the statistical behavior of wind vector estimates in order to identify specific features and characterize given models. Given the design philosophy and architecture, this system can be integrated into next generation autonomous UAS flight management systems as part of the waypoint sequencing and trajectory optimization functions. A test case in the north-Seattle area is presented, which is simulated using a 6DOF model with different wind scenarios which resulted into considerable energy gains either by heeding the wind field during the waypoint sequencing and during the mission execution. Results show that there is a significant improvement on the energy efficiency with an energy consumption reduced by 10% in the presence of wind."

This paper documents the process by which the collision avoidance region was defined. Three candidate definitions were evaluated on 1.3 million simulated pairwise encounters between UAS and manned aircraft covering a wide range of horizontal and vertical closure rates, angles, and miss distances. Each definition was evaluated with regard to UAS DAA interoperability with manned aircraft collision avoidance in terms of how well it achieved: 1) the primary objective of restricting DAA vertical guidance prior to RAs when the aircraft are close, and 2) the secondary objective of avoiding unnecessary restrictions of DAA vertical guidance at DAA alerts when the aircraft are further apart. The collision avoidance region definition that fully achieves the primary objective and best achieves the secondary objective was recommended to and accepted by the UAS community in the United States. By this definition, UAS and manned aircraft are in the collision avoidance region where DAA vertical guidance is restricted when the time to closest point of approach (CPA) is less than 50 seconds and either the time to co-altitude is less than 50 seconds or the current vertical separation is less than 800 feet."

We apply our methods to five airports: Newark Liberty International airport, John F. Kennedy International airport, LaGuardia airport, Philadelphia International airport, and Atlanta International airport. We find that the importance of convective weather depends on both its distance and direction from the airport. From the logistic regression we learn that both regional convective weather, as captured by the weights found in the SVM, and local weather are statistically significant. Convective weather is, however, the most important factor. Our models are found to have high accuracy and low false positive rates, but also low true positive rates because of the imbalance in our data."

It relies on a lexicographic modeling architecture based on effi-ciency (i.e., meeting airline scheduling preferences), equity (i.e., balancing scheduling adjustments fairly among the airlines), and reliability (i.e., mitigating airport congestion) objectives, subject to scheduling and network connectivity constraints.

While most existing forecasting models are econometric or statistical in nature, incorporating a more behavioral understanding of airline competition into the forecasts and planning process represents a significant opportunity to improve their efficacy. With these possibilities in mind, we develop a two-stage game-theoretic model of airline capacity allocation decisions under competition. We first demonstrate desirable theoretical properties and computational tractability of our model, and then exploit them to develop solution algorithms with very fast convergence properties to enable rapid generation of forecasts, requiring only a few seconds of run-time. We then solve our model to equilibrium of the two-stage game using a real-world dataset based on an 11-airport, four-airline network from the western United States. The out-of-sample validations of traffic predictions at the airport and OD (origin-destination) level indicate a good fit to real-world traffic data for various look-ahead times and at various levels of granularity. We thus demonstrate that a behaviorally consistent two-stage game model of airline competition provides a good fit to observed airline operations at various levels of aggregation, in turn highlighting the potential of game-theoretic models to improve air traffic forecasting and scenario analysis."

Our approach, which employs the Majority Judgment voting mechanism, enables those flight operators impacted by a potential TMI to provide service level preference information to an air navigation service provider (ANSP) that initiates the TMI. The output of the process is a numeric vector that specifies performance goals for the TMI enabling the ANSP to tradeoff competing performance criteria, when designing the TMI. Earlier work has described key compo-nents of the overall approach. This paper gives a comprehensive view and also gives the results of a fast-time simulation benefits assessment and a human-in-the-loop simulation."
