Efficient and robust tools to handle airport operations are needed along with a better understanding of passengers' interests and concerns. Among various airport operations, this paper studies airport gate scheduling for improved passengers' experience. Three objectives accounting for passengers, aircraft, and operation are presented. Trade-offs between these objectives are analyzed, and a balancing objective function is proposed. The results show that the balanced objective can improve the efficiency of traffic flow in passenger terminals and on ramps, as well as the robustness of gate operations."

An operational demonstration of these integrated  technologies, i.e., the ATM Technology Demonstration #1 (ATD-1), is slated for 2016. Human-in-the-loop  simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the ATD-1 system and validate operational  feasibility. The ATD-1 system was found to be robust to scenarios with saturated demand levels and high  levels of system delay. High throughput, 10% above baseline demand levels, and schedule conformance less  than 20 seconds at the 75th percentile were achievable. The flight-deck interval management capabilities  also improved the median schedule conformance at the final approach fix from 5 to 3 seconds and with less  variance."

Two key components of NextGen are Performance Based Navigation (PBN) and the Optimization of Airspace and Procedures in the Metroplex (OAPM). PBN leverages state-of-the-art navigation technologies, such as satellite-based Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP), to improve airport access, shorten flight paths, and increase en route efficiency. OAPM is a systematic and expedited approach to implementing PBN procedures and airspace changes.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking to quantify the benefits of Performance Based Navigation (PBN). The approach is to identify all PBN benefit mechanisms, develop explicit models capturing those mechanisms, and conduct simulations to quantify their impacts under representative operating conditions. In support of this effort, we investigated the throughput impact of implementing PBN to mitigate metroplex inefficiencies. Metroplex inefficiencies identified in this study involved individual or multiple airports, typically occurred in the terminal airspace domain, and impacted both departures and arrivals. PBN capabilities included RNAV Standard Instrument Departure (SID) and Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) procedures, and RNP Approval Required (AR) final approach procedures. The investigation included simulations to evaluate the throughput impacts of RNAV SIDs or STARs in addressing metroplex inefficiencies. We formulated simple, generic queuing system-based models of the baseline SIDs or STARs capturing the inefficiency, and the RNAV SIDs or STARs mitigating the inefficiency. We then extended the models to represent instances in the Northern California metroplex. Results show that RNAV SIDs and STARs demonstrated significant increases in throughput compared with baseline SIDs and STARs, particularly at saturated traffic demand levels. This paper describes the modeling assumptions, methods, and results including the quantitative throughput impacts and their sensitivity to traffic level, traffic distribution, and the in-trail separation minima."

A shadow evaluation was conducted in 2011, followed by an operational evaluation in 2012. The execution of these evaluations required collaboration and joint support across various agencies and organizations, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Weather Service (NWS), Mosaic ATM, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, along with the participation of the National Airspace System (NAS) user community. The shadow evaluation in 2011 showed that ground delays issued during the initial GDP could have been reduced by 20% if GPSM’s recommendations had been used operationally. These promising results led to an operational evaluation the following year. Despite challenges related to unexpected weather patterns, weather sensor outages, and slow user acceptance, analytical results show that GPSM provided benefits when used in operational decision making. On days where GPSM recommendations were closely followed, ground delays were on average 20% lower relative to days where recommendations were not followed, consistent with expectations set in 2011. The gap between planned and observed arrival rates fell by 29% relative to the preceding three years."

This paper reports on a study of the SARDA concept at three new airports – Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT), and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  The investigation of SARDA at these new airports included both fast-time simulation experiments as well as a human factors evaluation.  A fast-time simulation was developed for PHL, CLT, and LAX airports, capable of simulating both baseline operations and operations with NASA’s SARDA concept in use.  Multiple traffic scenarios were simulated at each airport and metrics detailing the differences between the SARDA and baseline operations analyzed.  Results supported the conclusion that SARDA provides substantial benefits at all three airports.  To complement the simulations, structured interviews were conducted with retired air traffic controllers who had experience at the focus airports.  The human factors study provided a qualitative, alternative investigation into how SARDA would operate at these airports, and identified issues not observable through the simulations as well as additional concept and algorithmic requirements related to off-nominal situations."

The flight trials evaluated the operational concept of meeting metering  times into the terminal area using the Required Time-of-Arrival (RTA) function available in modern Flight  Management Systems (FMSs). The trial objectives were to test the concept on a large scale, streamline the  process of assigning an RTA, and facilitate an in-depth evaluation of the utility of RTA as a flow  management tool for Air Traffic Control (ATC) and operators. Findings show that the Boeing 737 Next  Generation (B737NG) aircraft equipped with GE Aviation FMSs are capable of meeting the technical  performance expectations of RTA. A total of 833 Alaska Airline (ASA) revenue flights participated in the  trials, with 595 aircraft (71%) executing an RTA to completion, and 575 of those 595 (96.6%) arriving  within a 30 second tolerance. The trials identify several areas where additional research, standardization,  and automation enhancements are needed for RTA to be operationally viable."

However, most flow identification algorithms in the literature rely solely on  spatial clustering, without considering the temporal dimension. Temporal characterization of flows is  important, as it: enables identification of salient air traffic features, provides a basis for scenario  (“what-if”) analyses, and allows for a more robust distillation of large and time-varying air traffic  datasets.  To address this shortcoming, this work proposes a methodology for identifying flows which persist over an  arbitrary time span. This process leverages a generic Spectral Clustering framework, building upon the  methodologies established by Enriquez and Kurcz [4]. This algorithmic approach produces robust results,  while remaining easy to implement and being computationally inexpensive. We present two examples to show  the promise of this algorithm. First, the algorithm is used to automatically identify days in which  irregular air traffic patterns occur in the Miami International Airport (MIA) terminal airspace. Second, we  use this algorithm to help identify the minimum required number of new Performance Based Navigation (PBN)  arrival and departure procedures in the National Airspace (NAS), based on six months of historic data."

In this program, the CRISTAL initiative provides data from  validation trials in each country, to test the ADS-B technology in real scenarios where the operational  needs exist. The ADS-B system is expected to play a key role to facilitate some of the safety-critical  functions envisioned under the future operational concepts, including self-separation and Air Traffic  Control based separation with reduced separation minima. ADS-B is a very complex system, highly dependent  on the navigation and communication systems. A rigorous, clear and comprehensive assessment method is  required to ensure that it is safe to operate in any particular context. This paper proposes a  comprehensive framework to evaluate ADS-B data (obtained from NATS CRISTAL project) performance to assess  whether it can meet the accuracy, latency and update rate requirements to support the above-mentioned  safety-critical applications. In the proposed framework, Global Positioning System (GPS) data from aircraft  navigation system are used as the reference data to validate ADS-B data accuracy as recorded by ground  stations. The framework begins by decoding both sets of data (ADS-B and GPS) into the ASCII format. Both  sets are then correlated based on the time and horizontal position, the most challenging task in the data  evaluation process. A statistical evaluation is carried out in terms of accuracy, latency and update rate.  The key challenges in this analysis and errors identified in each dataset are discussed in this paper."

Improvements in aircraft navigation precision associated with PBN operations enable the development of advanced spacing concepts that evolve currently applicable separation standards. The Equivalent Lateral Spacing Operation (ELSO) concept was developed to advance the current 15-degree divergence requirement for independent parallel as well as successive departures and enables reduced-divergence departure operations. The concept was first presented at the Ninth ATM Seminar in 2011. The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL) implemented reduced-divergence Area Navigation (RNAV) departure procedures based on this concept on 20 October 2011. This paper outlines the standard concept and reviews KATL’s designs of RNAV ELSO procedures. It also describes the implementation approach taken to demonstrate the standard concept and presents the methodologies developed to characterize associated operational changes and estimate resulting benefits. For the 2011 level of departure demand, the results indicate a net average operator benefit of $44.00 per KATL departure and a net annual operator benefit of $19.2 million at the airport. Successful operational demonstration of the ELSO concept at KATL paves the way for regulatory changes that adopt the concept as a separation standard."

The situation is mostly influenced by voice communications between controller and pilots. Hence, voice communication is an important part for the human operator to implement his plans. Voice communication runs independent and in parallel to the process the automation performs to understand the situation. Therefore, the automation, specifically the support system, is not aware of agreements between human operators. Even worse, the operators have additional effort to inform the support systems about their communication, i.e. their intents. This additional effort can be avoided by using automatic speech recognition systems (ASR). Nowadays, ASR is used in many applications, e.g. Siri® in Apple's iPhone®.   This paper focuses on the integration of ASR with DLR's arrival manager 4D-CARMA. ASR improves situation awareness of both assistant system and controller. As the controller is responsible for his advisories he sometimes deviates from the recommendations of the automation. The automation often needs at least 40 seconds until it recognizes the deviations from the plan if radar data is available only. Trials performed at DLR's Institute of Flight Guidance have shown that ASR can reduce this deviation time of an Arrival Manager (AMAN) by approx. 90% down to 5 seconds.j  As a side-effect, the combination of ASR and AMAN also improves the performance of ASR. The AMAN provides context information about the current and estimated future situations. It creates hypotheses on controller intents and predicts which advisories the controller will probably transmit via voice. First trials have shown that this approach can reduce the word error rate by up to 80%. This can foster the use of ASR in ATM."

The study shows how Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs) observe traffic from a Tower Control Working Position at Airport Erfurt-Weimar (ERF) in comparison to a Remote Controller Working Position. The validation exercise targets low traffic density airports. Shadow-mode trials were used to cover perceptual, operational and human factors aspects of a Remote Tower System, including a live video panorama and a German Aerospace Center (DLR) research aircraft. The aircraft was used to fly different maneuvers within the aerodrome. These maneuvers allow insights on the detectability of an aircraft within different distances from the tower and the gathering of operation information about an aircraft status. In addition, a Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) vehicle was used to position static objects on the airfield to determine the detectability of these objects for different distances to the Control Tower (RTO-camera system). Eight ATCOs from the DFS participated in the validation exercise. Time-synchronized questionnaires for the controller working position remote (CWP-remote) and the controller working position tower (CWP-tower) were applied, addressing operational relevant questions to the ATCOs. The results reveal that the information sources play a different role at the CWP-remote than for the CWP-tower. The results are discussed taking performance and subjective data into consideration. Further, the implications for the consolidation of functional requirements and system specifications for a future remote tower system are worked out."

Mass is a key parameter for climb prediction. It is currently not available to ground- based trajectory predictors because it is considered a competitive parameter by many airlines. There is hope that the aircraft mass might become widely available someday, but in the meantime it is possible to estimate an equivalent mass from the data already available, assuming the thrust to be known (maximum climb thrust for example). In this paper, we compare the performances of two mass esti- mation methods proposed in recent publications. Both methods estimate the aircraft mass by fitting the modeled energy rate (i.e. the power of the forces acting on the aircraft) with the energy rate observed at several points of the past trajectory. The first method, proposed by Schultz et al., dynamically adjusts the weight parameter so as to fit the energy rate, using an adaptive sensitivity parameter to weight each observation. The second method, introduced in one of our previous publications, estimates the mass by minimizing the quadratic error on the observed energy rate, taking advantage of the polynomial expression of the modeled power when using the BADA model. The robustness of both methods to the observation errors is assessed, using simulated data with various distributions of the noise added to the observed state variables. The results show that both methods are able to find mass estimates that are very close to the “actual” mass, with slightly better performances for the least squares method."

In the FIM application, an aircraft’s arrival time at an airport is estimated while it is in flight, and its airspeed is controlled to achieve an assigned time spacing between its immediately preceding aircraft at the runway threshold. In order to evaluate the performance of the FIM application, this paper simulates CDO based on the FIM application for arrivals at Tokyo International Airport. A medium-fidelity aircraft model, which includes Vertical/Lateral NaVigation (VNAV/LNAV) autopilot modes, an engine system, and a Total Energy Control System (TECS), is implemented in a fast-time simulation. Potential CDO arrival routes at Tokyo International Airport are proposed. The simulation results evaluate the accuracy of FIM-based time spacing and fuel consumption."

IDRP provides demand estimates for departure fixes and routes in terminal airspace, including identification of specific flights impacted by capacity constraints, their route information, and accurate estimates of their expected take-off times. In general, IDRP benefits accrue when there is contention for departure resources (runways, fixes, routes, sectors), plus the feasibility of off-loading or otherwise balancing demand as a means of mitigating delay. This scenario is common in the New York area, where the prototype has been installed since 2009. In 2011 and 2012, field evaluations were conducted at tower, terminal, and center facilities. These evaluations allowed the capture of “use cases”—instances of essential applications of the tool. These use cases were later examined via offline replay, and led to benefits analyses in which a queuing model was employed to compare scenarios with and without IDRP. The modeling suggests significant benefits are attributable to IDRP."

The clearances can be lengthy and complex, which necessitates data link communications to allow for message permanence and integration into the autoflight systems (i.e., “autoload” capability). This paper examines the use of flight deck data link communications for strategic and tactical clearance usage in the terminal area. A human-in-the-loop simulation was conducted using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator, with ten commercial flight crews as participants. Data were collected from six flight scenarios in the San Francisco terminal airspace. The variables of interest were ATC message modality (voice v. data link), temporal aspect of the message (tactical v. strategic) and message length. Dependent variables were message response times, communication clarifications, communication-related errors, and pilot workload. Response time results were longer in data link compared to voice, a finding that has been consistently revealed in a number of other simulations [1]. In addition, strategic clearances and longer messages resulted in a greater number of clarifications and errors, suggesting an increase in uncertainty of message interpretation for the flight crews when compared to tactical clearances. The implications for strategic and compound clearance usage in NextGen and SESAR are discussed."

Thus, assessing the accuracy of such predictions is a key element in the research on time based operations in Air Traffic Management. The accuracy of a predicted Time of Arrival at a given fix will depend on the weather forecast that is available in the cockpit. For thousands of flights over a one year period, the forecasted winds that were uplinked from the ground to the aircraft have been compared with the winds measured by the aircraft. Given the large number of flights, a statistical approach was possible and the distributions (standard deviations and mean values) of the wind speed difference, wind direction difference and resulting groundspeed difference were computed. Additionally, results have been analyzed from two different perspectives. First, a waypoint-based analysis has been performed for which the statistics have been computed for all the waypoints of all the flights. The impact of different elements, e.g. flight of phase, wind magnitude, waypoint altitude, season, aircraft tail number and forecast latency has been assessed. It seems that the wind magnitude and the forecast latency are the main drivers. Secondly, a trajectory-based analysis has been performed for which the data along a complete descent profile has been averaged for each flight, to obtain an idea of the impact of the wind forecasts on the average ground speed uncertainty during descent. This analysis has shown that the difference in average ground speed during descent that would result from applying the measured winds instead of the forecasted winds in the trajectory computations, is below 12 knots for 95% of the time."

The impact of aircraft emissions on the environment adds an additional dimension to the planning of aircraft operations. This paper describes a new simulation capability to analyze the relationship between air traffic operations and their impact on the environment. This is the first simulation to integrate all air traffic in the US based on flight plans, aircraft trajectory calculations based on predicted wind data, contrail calculations based on predicted temperature and humidity data, a common metric to combine the effects of different types of emissions, and algorithms to generate alternate trajectories for aircraft traveling between city-pairs. The integrated simulation is used to evaluate the energy efficiency of contrail reduction strategies. The aircraft trajectories are varied from their baseline flight plans to reduce contrails in three different ways: changes to altitude, optimal changes to planned route, and three-dimensional change of trajectory. The method is applied to three different scenarios: a single flight between a city-pair, all flights between 12 city-pairs, and all flights in the US airspace. Results for the 12 city-pairs show that contrail reduction involving horizontal route change only is not fuel efficient, the three-dimensional trajectory change produces the best results at a computational cost, and changes to the altitude only produces good results as well as the ability to add airspace capacity constraints. For the scenario of all flights in the US airspace, initial results based on one month data show that contrail reduction strategies involving altitude changes applied to medium and long-range flights on days with high-contrail activity provide the maximum environmental benefit for a small reduction in energy efficiency."

The legacy system in use today, Conflict Alert, relies primarily on a dead reckoning algorithm, whereas T-TSAFE uses intent information to augment dead reckoning. In previous experiments, T-TSAFE was found to reduce the rate of false alerts and increase time between the alert to the controller and a loss of separation over the legacy system. In the present study, T-TSAFE was tested under two meteorological conditions, 1) all aircraft operated under instrument flight regimen, and 2) some aircraft operated under mixed operating conditions. The tool was used to visually alert controllers to predicted Losses of separation throughout the terminal airspace, and show compression errors, on final approach. The performance of T-TSAFE on final approach was compared with Automated Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA), a tool recently deployed by the FAA. Results show that controllers did not report differences in workload or situational awareness between the T-TSAFE and ATPA cones but did prefer T-TSAFE features over ATPA functionality. T-TSAFE will provide one tool that shows alerts in the data blocks and compression errors via cones on the final approach, implementing all tactical conflict detection and alerting via one tool in TRACON airspace."

The distinction between pre- and post-clearance trajectories enabled an assessment of the impact of open versus closes clearances. Uncertainty was shown to be reducible to one-third of present levels with closed clearances and improved data exchange. Normalized conflict detection performance was sensitive to the transitioning state of flights, significantly more than to airspace.  Resulting improvements in resolution were shown to reduce conflict-induced perturbations by up to 3.5 nautical miles per flight hour.  The combined reduction in uncertainty and conflict-induced perturbations were evaluated against alternative TFM strategies.

This paper  presents the results of the human-in-the-loop evaluation of the tactical gate hold version of SARDA in a  360? simulated tower setting. The simulations were conducted for the east side of the Dallas/Fort Worth  airport. The new system provides gate hold, Ground Controller and Local Controller advisories based on a  single scheduler. Simulations were conducted with SARDA on and off, the off case reflecting current day  operations with no gate hold. Scenarios based on medium (1.2x current levels) and heavy (1.5x current  levels) traffic were explored. Data collected from the simulation were analyzed for runway usage, delay for  departures and arrivals, and fuel consumption. Further, Traffic Management Initiatives were introduced for  a subset of the aircraft. Results indicated that runway usage did not change with the use of SARDA, i.e.,  there was no loss in runway throughput as compared to baseline. Taxiing delay was significantly reduced  with the use of advisory by 45% in medium scenarios and 60% in heavy. Observed gate-holds were less than 15  minutes in all but one scenario, and even in this scenario 95% of the aircraft had a gate hold of less than  15 minutes. Arrival delay was unaffected by the use of advisory. Total fuel consumption was also reduced by  23% in medium traffic and 33% in heavy. TMI compliance appeared unaffected by the advisory."

The ground speed reduction in headwind conditions results in an increase in the time spacing between each arrival pair for distance-based separations. The Time Based Separation (TBS) concept changes the separation rules on final approach from distance based to time based to stabilize the time spacing between arrival pairs across headwind conditions in order to recover the lost landing rate currently experienced. This paper presents the key results of the final research phase of the validation of the TBS concept. This validation has been conducted in the framework of the SESAR Development phase project P06.08.01 Flexible and Dynamic Use of Wake Turbulence Separations. The work in P06.08.01 started in 2010 and is about to be finalized in February 2013 achieving pre-industrial development (V3) maturity level. The project has developed and assessed both the generic TBS concept and a local adaptation of the concept to the London Heathrow operating environment. The scope of this paper is focused on the validation of the concept for London Heathrow (LHR) airport covering the real-time simulation results and the wake turbulence safety data analysis results."

This paper presents a framework for development of operator flexibility metrics, with a first test-case application to management of departure queues. Through the use of virtual queuing (VQ) in departure operations, operators are provided with additional flexibility in prioritizing flights for departure. VQ allows flights whose delays are more expensive to skip ahead in the departure queue, while other flights with less expensive delays move back. Operators are expected to benefit significantly from the additional flexibility of VQ because the cost of departure queuing delays can vary widely among different flights due to differences in delay already accumulated, different number and types of passengers, and considerations such as crew time limits. Flexibility metrics derived from delay recovered with VQ relative to physical queuing (PQ) are compared under a variety of operational scenarios. These scenarios include: non-linear delay costs, variable costs by aircraft type, flexibility across all flights and flexibility constrained to intra-operator exchanges, as well as small physical queues at the departure runway end. Flexibility measures have been defined that are not dependent on the specifics of the operator business case (i.e., cost structure or decision criteria). This is accomplished through a comparative assessment of flexibility metrics derived from fast-time simulations assuming a variety of operator cost functions and optimization objectives. Results show that metrics can be normalized to allow operators, based upon their cost-structure and optimization objectives, to infer a value of improved flexibility. Results also indicate that constraining exchanges to intra-operator and including small physical queues at the departure runway end substantially reduce the flexibility performance of VQ, which implies that operational mechanisms to permit inter-operator exchanges and to reduce the size of small physical queues"

To accurately assess the prospects of voluntary equipage, policymakers must understand the value of NextGen improvements as seen from the airlines’ perspective. Traditional cost-benefit valuation methods are not well suited for providing this perspective. The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) conducted research to better understand how airlines perceive NextGen, and how they internalize changes in flight performance in their operations. This understanding was pursued through interviews with airline managers and with regression analysis of historical airline operational data. We observe the pervasiveness of block time management in response to operational changes for a subset of airlines, and the impact of this response on various aspects of airline operations. The results of this research will be used to incorporate airline response into operational modeling and benefit valuation methodologies."

The Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) current operational capacity model provides traffic alert thresholds based on hand-off workload.  It provides accurate estimates for most sectors, but tends to over-estimate capacity in both small and large sectors, since it does not account for conflict-resolution and recurring workload.  Because of those omissions it cannot be applied to benefits analysis of proposed air traffic management workload reduction initiatives.  Furthermore, it cannot be extended to estimate capacity when hazardous weather increases all workload types.   Previously, we developed a model that accounts for all task types.  Extensions of the model to handle hazardous weather introduced additional parameters.  We determine the workload parameters by regressing against busy-day peak traffic counts for en route sectors.  In this paper we analyze the impact of parameter ambiguity on benefit analyses.  We also present the results of a new regression against a comprehensive traffic database in the United States that confirms earlier trial findings based on limited data.  Finally, we modify the weather-impacted sector capacity model to provide a more stable normalized capacity measure and illustrate its potential application to operational sector capacity forecasts."

The goal of strategic traffic flow management is to develop traffic management initiatives that mitigate potential large-scale congestion in the future when the imbalance cannot be effectively managed with tactical measures.  Thus, despite the inherent uncertainties in the demand and capacity forecasts at longer look-ahead times, decisions regarding National Airspace-wide behavior are necessary.  As such it is desirable to develop a decision support system that provides quantitative feedback on predicted traffic impact and aids in developing effective solutions.  This paper proposes a framework to address this need by simulating and evaluating the effectiveness of proposed strategies across a variety of metrics.  Using a realistic example taken from historic data, we explore the traffic management design space by varying the parameters associated with different management initiatives.  The results are compared to those obtained using a naïve heuristic optimization approach and recommendations on requirements for future design approaches are provided."

NASA and American Airlines (AA) are conducting an operational trial of DWR at the AA System Operations Center in Fort Worth, Texas.  The trial includes only AA flights in Fort Worth Center airspace.  Over the period from July 31, 2012 through October 31, 2012, 45% of routes proposed by DWR and evaluated by AA users, air traffic control coordinators and flight dispatchers, were rated as acceptable as proposed or with some modifications.  The wind-corrected potential flying time savings for these acceptable routes totaled 470 flying min.  DWR identified reroutes offering an additional 4,066 min of potential flying time savings for AA flights, but these routes were not evaluated due to staffing limitations.  A sector congestion analysis shows that in only three out of 83 DWR routes rated acceptable by AA staff were the flights predicted to fly through a congested sector inside of 30 min downstream of present position.  This shows that users considered sector congestion data provided by DWR automation and in nearly all cases did not accept routes through over-capacity sectors."

In addition to recording TOD, the cruise altitude, final altitude, cruise Mach, descent speed, wind, and engine type were also identified for use as the independent variables in the regression analysis.  Both first-order and second-order models are considered, where cross-validation, hypothesis testing, and additional analysis are used to compare models.  This identifies the models that should give the smallest errors if used to predict TOD location for new data in the future.  A model that is linear in TOD altitude, final altitude, descent speed, and wind gives an estimated standard deviation of 3.9~nmi for TOD location given the trajectory parameters, which means about 80\% of predictions would have error less than 5~nmi in absolute value. This accuracy is better than demonstrated by other ground automation predictions using kinetic models. Furthermore, this approach would enable online learning of the model. Additional data or further knowledge of algorithms is necessary to conclude definitively that no second-order terms are appropriate.  Possible applications of the linear model are described, including enabling arriving aircraft to fly optimized descents computed by the FMS even in congested airspace."

The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate the tool’s usability to ensure that its claimed performance benefits are not being realized at the cost of increasing the work burden on controllers. The study analyzed workload ratings and questionnaire responses collected during a human-in-the-loop simulation experiment and assessed the effects of the SARDA advisories on the controllers’ cognitive resources (e.g., workload, spare attention) and satisfaction. The results showed that SARDA reduced the controllers’ workload and increased their perceived spare attention. SARDA also made workload and attention levels less susceptible to the effects of increases in the traffic load. The questionnaire responses suggested that the controllers generally were satisfied with the ease of use of the tool and the intended benefits of the SARDA concept, but with slight reservations. Sharing high-level reasoning behind SARDA’s optimization process with the controllers may help the concept to gain more trust from them."

To determine the climate change contribution due to an individual emission as function of emission location, altitude and time, four-dimensional climate cost functions are computed. Therefore the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry model (EMAC) has been employed. The emitted trace species are transported by means of the Lagrangian advection scheme ATTILA. To evaluate the climate impact from several emission locations and dates within one simulation, a new submodel (AIRTRAC) has been developed. Chemical changes of ozone, methane and water vapor, as well as contrail formation and aging caused by a particular emission are computed directly on air parcels. For each emission location and date, the changes of radiatively active species and the corresponding radiative forcings are computed, from which the climate cost functions are derived. The climate cost functions form the basis for the optimization of air traffic flight trajectories with respect to minimum climate impact. Typical weather situations are considered and differences in climate impact are investigated. The North Atlantic flight corridor is considered for route optimization."

This study goes a step further and investigates the application of RTA to a real sequence of arriving aircraft into Melbourne Australia. Assuming that the actual arrival times were Controlled Time of Arrivals (CTAs) assigned to each aircraft, the study examines if the airborne RTA solution would work. Three scenarios were compared: a baseline scenario being the actual flown trajectories in a two hour time-span into Melbourne, a scenario in which the sequential landing slot times of the baseline scenario were assigned as CTAs and a third scenario in which the landing slots could be freely redistributed to the inbound traffic as CTAs. The research found that pressure on the terminal area would sometimes require aircraft to lose more time than possible through the RTA capability. Using linear holding as an additional measure to absorb extensive delays, up to 500NM (5%) of total track reduction and 1300kg (3%) of total fuel consumption could be saved in the scenario with landing slots freely distributed as CTAs, compared to the baseline scenario. Assigning CTAs in an arrival sequence requires the ground system to have an accurate trajectory predictor to propose additional delay measures (path stretching, linear holding) if necessary. Reducing the achievable time window of the aircraft to add control margin to the RTA function, had a negative impact and increased the amount of intervention other than speed control required to solve the sequence. It was concluded that the RTA capability is not a complete solution but merely a tool to assist in managing the increasing complexity of air traffic."

With two key changes the throughput can be improved without affecting safety: integrating the arrival and departure streams and increasing communication between the Tower and the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON). The airports include those that conduct arrival and departure operations to crossing or converging runways, or conduct same runway operations such as Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (KDCA) or London’s Gatwick Airport (EGKK). Typically at these types of airports, a static interval is set between arriving flights so that the airport’s Tower Controller can depart aircraft in the gaps. The static interval is maintained even without any waiting departures and is usually adjusted only with verbal coordination between the Tower and TRACON. At these airports, throughput can be improved by providing dynamic spacing guidance to Approach Controllers that accounts for the departure queue. The MITRE Corporation’s Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) is investigating methods to provide automated arrival spacing guidance. A research prototype called the Automated Integration of Arrival/Departure Schedules provides automated arrival spacing guidance for Approach Controllers. The guidance communicates arrival intervals depending on the type and order of departure aircraft queued at or taxiing to the dependent runway. It provides an indication to use minimum arrival spacing when there are no queued departures. MITRE has conducted fast-time and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulations to assess the feasibility of this solution in terms of adherence to spacing guidance and workload impacts. Controllers achieved a high level of conformance to guidance and workload levels were within a safe range.

While some events, such as specific categories of conflicts, can be designed in the scenario, the interaction of the humans can undo these events early in the simulation. This poses a challenge and the objective of the experiment can become difficult to meet.  Computational Red Teaming (CRT) is a computational environment that attempts to play devil advocates. A CRT is designed and used in this paper to monitor, re-steer and adjust traffic events in these real-time air-traffic simulation environments. The approach was able to correct events successfully, when possible. In situations were the time to correct events is greater than the time remaining for the experiments or when the constraints of the scenario do not allow certain steering requests to be issued or accepted, those events can't be recreated. Therefore, analysts are advised to avoid designing events closer to the end of the session to allow for the CRT to take corrective actions if the session does not evolve as planned."

The system was initially optimized to increase safety and decrease alerts. Recent work has focused on tuning ACAS X to also meet operational suitability and pilot acceptability performance metrics. An iterative tuning process reduced the operational impact on the air traffic system and improved acceptability of alerts. This paper summarizes a fifteen-month effort that resulted in substantial improvements. Compared with TCAS, ACAS X reduces collision risk by 59%, lowers the alert rate by 59%, and issues 28% fewer disruptive alerts.

The shared common view of the trajectory is translated into an agreed 2D route and a time constraint. The implementation of the I4D concept is distributed over aircraft avionics systems and ATM automation systems across navigation and communication domains. The I4D first flight trial was performed on 10 February 2012 following a series of validation exercises in simulator to assess the concept and prepare all actors for the flight. The Airbus A320 Test Aircraft took off from Toulouse-Blagnac airport (France) for Stockholm Arlanda (Sweden) and tested all I4D key elements over six flight legs. The avionics modifications included an advanced Flight Management System (FMS), an onboard digital communication unit and the cockpit displays; ATM automation systems supported Ground-Ground coordination among the relevant Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and integrated down-linked aircraft trajectory information. Avionics interoperability was tested through the use of two independently developed FMS. The technical feasibility of the concept was demonstrated from both the crew and the controllers standpoints. In addition, key performance requirements such as tolerance on the mutually agreed time constraint was met with a significant margin on all legs where it was applied. The analysis of the validation exercise led to the publication of a series of recommendations for systems modifications, further investigations to be performed in flight test or simulation and for short-term actions in datalink communication and navigation standardization groups."

To participate in an IM operation, an aircraft must be equipped with avionics that provide speeds to achieve and maintain a desired spacing interval relative to another aircraft.  It is not expected that all aircraft will be equipped with the necessary avionics, but rather that IM fits into a larger arrival management concept developed to support the broader mixed-equipage environment.  Arrival management concepts are comprised of three parts: a ground-based sequencing and scheduling function to develop an overall arrival strategy, ground-based tools to support the management of aircraft to that schedule, and the IM tools necessary for the IM operation (i.e., ground-based set-up, initiation, and monitoring, and the flight-deck tools to conduct the IM operation).  The Federal Aviation Administration is deploying a near-term ground-automation system to support metering operations in the National Airspace System, which fall within the first two components of the arrival management concept.  The near-term system will include sequencing and scheduling functions and tools to help air traffic controllers in managing aircraft to meet their scheduled times of arrival (STAs) at meter points.  This paper presents a methodology for determining the required delivery accuracy at the meter points in order to achieve desired flow rates, adequate separation at the meter points, and to enable aircraft to meet their STAs while remaining on their RNAV arrivals, which will reduce costly vectoring and holding.

This paper introduces a new framework that separates the model from the solver so as to be able to: first, enhance the model with as many refinements (e.g. wind and trajectory uncertainties) as necessary to comply with operational constraints; second, compare different resolution methods on the same data, which is one of the crucial aspects of scientific research. To this aim, our framework can generate a benchmark of conflict resolution problems built with various scenarios involving a given number of aircraft, different levels of uncertainties and number of maneuvers. We then compare two different optimization paradigms, Evolutionary Algorithm and Constraint Programming, which can efficiently solve difficult instances in near real time, to illustrate the usefulness of our approach."

A trade-off exists when defining this radius: big radii distribute the  required delay among more aircraft and reduce the airborne holding delay close to the destination airport, while the probability to realize  unnecessary delay increases if the program is canceled before planned. In order to overcome part of this drawback, a cost based cruise  speed reduction strategy aiming at realizing airborne delay was suggested by the authors in previous publications. By flying slower, at a  specific speed, aircraft that are airborne can recover part of their initially assigned delay without incurring extra cost if the GDP is canceled  before planned. In this paper, the effect of the exemption radius is assessed when applying this strategy and a case study is presented by  analyzing all the GDPs that took place at Chicago O'Hare International Airport during one year. Results show that by the introduction of this  technique, more delay can be saved. Thus, it is possible to define larger radii of exemption, reducing partially the drawbacks associated  with smaller radii."

The simulations are devoted to maturing the integrated system for field demonstration, and refining the controller tools, clearance phraseology, and procedures specified in the associated concept of operations. The results indicate a variety of factors impact the concept’s safety and viability from a controller’s perspective, including en-route preconditioning of arrival flows, useable clearance phraseology, and the characteristics of airspace, routes, and traffic-management methods in use at a particular site. Clear understanding of automation behavior and required shifts in roles and responsibilities is important for controller acceptance and realizing potential benefits. This paper discusses the simulations, drawing parallels with results from related European efforts. The most recent study found en-route controllers can effectively precondition arrival flows, which significantly improved route conformance during CDOs. Controllers found the tools acceptable, in line with previous studies."

This vital ability of the ecosystem makes resilience a very desirable property of man-made socio-technical systems. The European ATM System, which in future will be set up to achieve the performance targets given by SESAR, is such a socio-technical system. A lot of contradictory definitions of the term resilience in different domains fall into two big categories with semantical meanings of ""resilience"" or ""robustness"". Currently, in the ATM Context exists a definition of resilience from the safety science perspective only. This paper will apply a new definition of resilience and robustness on the ATM System to help realizing the agreed performance targets under the influence of disturbances. To follow this approach, a clear differentiation between both terms has to be carried out.  The aim of this conceptual paper is to present a developed framework that incorporates concepts of robustness, resilience and relevant terms such as disturbance, stress and perturbation. This is complemented by an according decision-making chain. Furthermore, this paper suggests some qualitative and quantitative forms of measures of resilience and robustness and provides a structured approach for the investigation of both terms. By incorporating the presented terminology in order to identify new methods to increase resilience or robustness, a new  modeling approach will be introduced. This will be complemented by an according algorithm. The structure of the modeling approach divides the ATM System into two - a sociological and a physical dimensions.  The  sociological dimension shall enable to reveal improvement potential in the  context of operational rules of particular stakeholders, adapting resources and finding alternative ways to achieve the given performance targets."

In addition, a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) supports accuracy and precision of the desired flight path. While the lateral guidance during current curved approach procedures is usually based on a position solution provided by satellite navigation systems in conjunction with inertial navigation systems, the vertical guidance is still based on measurements of a barometric altimeter. This type of approach with vertical guidance is supposed to enhance the situational awareness for pilots compared to non-precision approach procedures and reduce the risk for controlled flight into terrain. However, the accuracy of the barometric vertical guidance is inferior compared to precision approach procedures, temperature dependent and require the correct pressure setting for each approach in the aircraft. Therefore, novel curved approach procedures are supposed to rely solely on satellite navigation augmented by either a ground based or satellite based system and only optionally by inertial measurement systems. Such coupled (hybrid INS and GNSS) systems are usually highly integrated and monitored by a flight management system. Therefore, the requirements for the equipment of aircraft that are conducting such approach procedures are very stringent. Using only GBAS could relax those requirements. In this work, an option for precision curved approach procedures was investigated and tested in flight trials. This option is based on a GBAS. In general, different possibilities are imaginable to enable GBAS based curved approaches. For instance, GBAS could only serve as means to enhance the navigation performance to achieve stringent RNP requirements. Or GBAS could serve as the sole means to enable a curved approach. This option is described in this paper."

Nevertheless, simplesector load based on aircraft count remains the key planning figure in ATM & ATFM. The proposed complexity factors lack a commonmodel of causation (pre, peri, post controller intervention), which leads to case-specific workload dependencies. Motivated by EUROCON-TROL’s research in Single European Sky and recent THALES advances studying the introduction of dynamic density metrics in an operational ATFM environment, this study analyzes the predictive capabilities of complexity metrics towards (1) controller workload and (2) the level of safety (collision risk). By means of average-filtering and time-shifting, a linear prediction model’s coefficient of determination was improved significantly. For simulated controller  workload, a local optimum is situated at the current timeframe (r² ~ 0.7). For radar-data based collision risk, the bestprediction looks 130 s into the future (r² ~ 0.5). This observation is coherent with the findings for simulation-based collision risk (150 s, r² ~ 0.5)."

The experiments modeled a mixed-operations concept in which aircraft receiving ground-based separation services shared the airspace with aircraft providing their own separation service (i.e., self-separation). Ground-based separation was provided by air traffic controllers without automation tools, with tools, or by automation with controllers in a managing role.  Airborne self-separation was provided by airline pilots using self-separation automation enabled by airborne surveillance technology. The two experiments, one pilot-focused and the other controller-focused, addressed selected key issues of mixed operations: the impact of mixed operations on controller performance at four stages of NextGen implementation and the limits to which pilots with automation tools could take full responsibility for separation from ground-controlled aircraft.    Results indicate that the presence of self-separating aircraft had little impact on the controllers’ ability to provide separation services for ground-controlled aircraft. Performance was best in the most automated environment in which all aircraft were data communications equipped, ground-based separation was highly automated, and self-separating aircraft had access to trajectory intent for all aircraft. In less automated environments, reduced trajectory intent exchange and manual air traffic control limited safely achievable throughput and negatively impacted the maneuver efficiency of self-separating aircraft through high-density airspace.  Flight crews of self-separating aircraft prevented separation loss in all conflicts with detection time greater than one minute.  Pilots indicated a preference for at least five minute’s alerting notice and trajectory intent information on all aircraft.   When ground-managed aircraft intent was available, self-separating aircraft benefited from fewer conflict alerts and fewer required deviations from trajectory-based operations."

One method for reducing airport congestion is surface congestion management. The concept generally involves determining a limit to how many aircraft can efficiently taxi to departure runways, and then holding “excess” aircraft at the gate or in the ramp area with engines off instead of releasing them onto the active movement area during periods of high departure demand. This results in reduced congestion and taxi time, with jet fuel and emissions savings. In order to determine the appropriateness of deploying surface congestion management, estimates of the potential benefits at a wide range of airports into the future are necessary to assist with investment analysis decisions. To overcome challenges associated with the resulting wide spatial and temporal scope, a multi-fidelity modeling approach has been developed where high fidelity models are developed and executed for a small number of key airports, and these are used to inform, validate and extrapolate medium and low fidelity models which are applied to ever-broader sets of airports. Application of these models produce estimates of fuel savings from surface congestion management of 2.2-3.9 billion gallons across the top 35 US airports over the period 2010-2030, with a value of $5.5-9.5 billion. Additional benefits in the form of reduced climate and air quality-impacting emissions have also been estimated to have similar orders of magnitude to the fuel savings."

Data and case studies from Boston Logan International Airport, New York’s LaGuardia Airport and Philadelphia International Airport are used to illustrate the diversity in operating environments. The paper then proposes techniques for characterizing airport surface operations using site surveys and operational data.

All these potential hazards have to be analysed upon there possible contribution to safety risk of the operation considered. In an agent-based safety risk assessment of ATM operations there are two approaches towards the assessment of the safety risk impacts of hazards. The direct way is to incorporate the hazard in the agent-based model, and to assess this agent-based model on safety risk by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. The alternative is to avoid the modelling of a potential hazard in the agent-based model, and instead assess the impact of the hazard on safety risk through sensitivity analysis and bias and uncertainty assessment. Because agent-based modelling and simulation of hazards may reveal emergent behaviour that remains invisible through sensitivity analysis, there is a need to know for each hazard how to model it in an agent-based approach. Hence the aim of this paper is to identify the types of agent-based model constructs for potential hazards in ATM. This study leads to the identification of 38 model constructs that are able to capture about 98% of the hazards considered in an agent-based model. The paper also shows how these agent-based model constructs relate to modelling approaches in various other aviation domains, such as system reliability, human performance simulation, Human Reliability Analysis, and aircraft trajectory simulation. The model construct ‘multi-agent situation awareness’ captures by far the highest percentage of hazards (41%). This model construct does not correspond to any of these four well established modelling areas."

In order to do it, we believe that the decision-support tool shall model directly the uncertainty at a trajectory level in order to propagate the uncertainty to the sector level. Then, the probability of congestion for any sector in the airspace can be computed. Since air traffic regulations and sector congestion are antagonist, we designed and implemented a multiobjective optimization algorithm for determining the best trade-off between these two criteria. The solution comes up as a set of alternatives for the multi-sector planner where the severity of the congestion cost is adjustable. In this paper, the Non- dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to solve an atificial benchmark problem involving 24 aircraft and 11 sectors, and is able to provide a good approximation of the Pareto front."

The microscopic model of the passenger behavior is based on the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), where the motion is defined as a one dimensional, stochastic, and time/space discrete process. The analyses of appreciable boarding strategies are focusing on expected time and standard deviation of the boarding. In the context of both reliable boarding progress and delay compensation during the turnaround our results emphasize the use of an additional door (20-25% savings) followed by a change of the boarding strategy (10-15% savings) or application of different seat layouts (3 % savings).

Numerous metrics for estimating it have been proposed including simple ones such as aircraft count and sophisticated ones representing traffic complexity. In this paper, an approach is presented for estimating airspace capacity that addresses two main factors: (1) the risk element in determining capacity, represented by the tradeoff between capacity and the ability to mitigate the risk of violating traffic management constraints, and (2) the cognitive element in determining capacity, represented by the control strategy used by different control schemes such as human control, automation control, or automation assisted control.  The approach is demonstrated using a risk mitigation metric, called adaptability, which estimates the number of feasible trajectories that are available to an aircraft, using a certain control strategy, to avoid violating traffic management constraints. Using this metric, the tradeoff between adaptability and capacity to absorb delay that exists in current human control behavior was identified through analysis of historical track data of two airspace sectors. This metric was also used to compare alternative control strategies in a simulated metering situation involving separation assurance and meeting required times of arrival at a fix. The comparison highlighted the higher capacity and adaptability levels that can be achieved with more efficient control strategies relative to human control. Thus, the presented analysis demonstrates the potential of risk mitigation metrics such as adaptability to estimate airspace capacity limits that achieve desired levels of risk mitigation under different control strategies and automation schemes."

However, detailed guidance in doing so is not provided. This paper aims at filling this gap with a proposed safety assessment methodology to value obstacle clearance violations around airports. It was applied for a safety case at Frankfurt Airport where a tower elevating 4 km out of threshold 25R violates severely obstacle limitation surfaces. The model refers to a takeoff and landing performance model (TLPM) computing precisely aircraft trajectories for both standard and engine out conditions at ground proximity forming the model’s reference data: The generated tracks are used to estimate collision risk considering stepwise EASA/FAA, EU-OPS & ICAO clearance criteria. Normal operations are assessed with a probabilistic analysis of empirical takeoff / landing track data generating the local actual navigation performance (ANP) at site. The ANP leads through integration to collision risk with any obstacle. This step passed, the obstacle is tested for clearance within a “5-step-plan” against all performance requirements for landing climb, and takeoff climb. The methodology so delivers a comprehensive risk picture: The presented safety case for Frankfurt Airport showed an equivalent safety level despite the standards violation: The collision risk during both normal and degraded performance operations was found to be still within ICAO CRM limits requiring only limited risk mitigation measures. The presented work should complement ICAO Doc. 9774 Appendix 3."

Which is the optimal heading change that will guarantee the desired separation distance with a minimum  reaction time? These same questions can be asked if it is the airliner that performs the separation  maneuver. In previous research, the authors showed that in the case the RPAS maneuvers, it has to do it  much in advance due to its typical poor flight performance at typical RPAS cruise altitudes. In this paper,  we address the safety margins that are left for the RPAS or the airline should any of them execute the  separation maneuver. We also investigate if those margins remain safe when the RPAS cannot comply with the  required separation maneuver and the airliner needs to initiate that maneuver as a last resort to avoid the  conflict. Dealing with an RPAS-airliner conflict opens a new dimension to the safety of the separation  maneuver. An RPAS that is commanded to maneuver and initiate a separation maneuver may become all the  sudden unresponsive (due to internal failure or due to the feared lost link situation). The paper also  assesses the operational point of view by simplifying the reaction times and conflict geometries by   grouping them in a small set of cases, regarding the probability of a loss of separation event."

Interviews with the airline and relevant work in ground transportation have shown that SBT and the historical block time distribution have a close relationship. A better understanding of this relationship is a major goal for the FAA and the airlines because the benefits includes less cost, more efficient operations and better performance in the National Airspace System. This paper investigates this relationship with empirical data and multiple regression models. The historical block time information is aggregated to individual flight level to keep track of the performance of the flight over a time period. The distribution of the flight time for a flight is depicted by the difference between every 10th percentiles. We found that departure delay plays a minor role in setting scheduled block-time, and that SBTs have decreasing sensitivity to historical flight times towards the right tail of the distribution. Airlines tend to act “optimistically” and are willing to experience delays in trade of a shorter SBT. We also include OD pair information in the model and found longer SBT is set for larger airports, as padding for busy traffic. Taking the heterogeneity in the behavior across airlines into consideration, we further decompose the dataset to study specific airlines. The historical flight time distribution has similar effect on SBT for different airlines, and low cost carriers tend to set a shorter SBT than legacy carriers. For legacy carriers, we found that American Airlines values level of service provided the most, whereas United Airlines has a really aggressive behavior to cut SBT. Legacy carriers also set a shorter SBT for flights between their own hubs, to avoid the disruption of early arrivals."

Furthermore, the approach is implemented on historic datasets from both Boston Logan International (BOS) and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) airports. Computational experience indicates that significant improvements can be achieved from this optimization, and that computational tractability is such that real-world implementation is possible."

Poisson regression was  used to analyze the daily count of OEs at various facilities. The occurrence of OEs was found to increase  approximately with the square of daily traffic at TRACON facilities. At TRACON facilities, where separation  violations are not automatically reported, an increase in reporting was seen after a new severity metric  was introduced in 2007. It was also found that large, consolidated TRACON facilities tend to behave like a  sum of several smaller facilities rather than a single larger facility with respect to the occurrence of  OEs vs daily traffic. Weather effects such as visibility and wind were found to influence the occurrence of  OEs as well. The model prediction for TRACON facilities is very good for the most severe OE types and very  poor for the least severe OE types, indicating many unobserved factors contributing to the reporting of the  least severe OE types in the terminal environment."

Many TBO concepts have been proposed to yield those benefits; among them is the Three-Dimensional Path Arrival Management (3D PAM) concept of operations. 3D PAM operations are accomplished via ground-based automation that provides speed and path advisories to assist controllers in meeting the meter schedule. On-board capabilities enable pilots to accept and efficiently execute the advisory-based clearance. The result is an increased amount of near-idle thrust descent operations and increased use of closed-loop clearances (with full availability of the speed profile and path for each flight). However, these changes, as beneficial as they are, impact how operations are predicted today by fielded en route medium-term conflict detection support capabilities (i.e., time horizon of 3 to 20 minutes). In order to be effective, the current conflict detection automation must be adapted to best support controllers. This paper describes an analysis completed to determine the performance of fielded en route medium-term conflict detection capabilities given these TBO operations and how it may be better adapted via parameter changes. Results show that parameter changes alone will not provide an acceptable level of conflict detection performance due to a high number of false alerts. While more complex changes, in terms of implementation, are less desirable, they may be needed in order to provide an acceptable level of conflict detection performance, with respect to missed and false alerts, for a 3D PAM operations environment as well as for other TBO concepts of operation."

Full-scale flight tests are necessary to validate ADS-B In applications and solidify message standards; however, such ventures are prohibitively expensive and current standards do not support all proposed applications. The 2012 NASA Aeronautics Academy at Langley Research Center explored the notion of emulating aircraft data links such as ADS-B with commercial in-flight Internet systems and electronic flight bags in order to provide a standards-independent and reduced-cost environment for validating deliverable ADS-B and alternate data link concepts of operations and solidifying ADS-B message standards in full-scale flight tests. By examining certification guidelines, technological requirements, available capabilities, and cost, this study has concluded that a Networked Air Traffic Infrastructure Validation Environment can be feasibly realized with minimum certification requirements, aircraft down time, or major expense by way of Class 2 electronic flight bags, any available in-flight Internet solution, and cloud-computing services."

A safe and efficient prediction is a prerequisite for the implementation of automated tools that detect and solve conflicts between trajectories. Moreover, regarding the safety constraints, it could be more reasonable to predict intervals rather than precise aircraft positions. In this paper, a standard point-mass model and statistical regression method is used to predict the altitude of climbing aircraft. In addition to the standard linear regression model, two common non-linear regression methods, neural networks and Loess are used. A dataset is extracted from two months of radar and meteorological recordings, and several potential explanatory variables are computed for every sampled climb segment. A Principal Component Analysis allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the problems, using only a subset of principal components as input to the regression methods. The prediction models are scored by performing a 10-fold cross-validation. Statistical regression results method appears promising. The experiment part shows that the proposed regression models are much more efficient than the standard point-mass model. The prediction intervals obtained by our methods have the advantage of being more reliable and narrower than those found by point-mass model."
